# Team_37_my_debtors
CoDebt is a web application that allows schools within a particular locality view, interact, and verify all debt information about a potential, present or past student. It's for school administrators, debtors and people who are interested in confirming their debt status. School administrators are able to create, retrieve, update and delete data upon authentication. Debtors can only view and contend in cases of perceived wrongful debt status.
